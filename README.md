# QHACKS '21:
Hello! Welcome to our Token Bot. In QHacks 2021 (the hackathon), our group consisting of @Harley-L, @barrackm, and 
@MSilver42 developed a bot that took advantage of the free credits from new users on the Distributed Compute Lab's 
network to gain infinite credits. These credits can be used to mine online currency (Bitcoin) and give the credits an 
inherent value. Using Selenium and MailSlurp as our python APIs, we were able to create bot emails and navigate the
platform. Then, we were able to transfer credits from the bots account to the main account. Achieving an efficiency of 
1150 credits per hour, our platform was able to gain 300x the normal amount of credits in a given period.

# Disclaimer: 
Before starting the project, our team told the CEO of Distributed Compute Labs of this potential problem and was given
the green light to test the security of their system. We did NOT break their system and made this to help better their
understanding of potential security risks.
